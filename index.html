        <p>Abundance is the first marketplace that allows backyard gardeners and small-scale producers to sell their products directly to consumers. Sell as little or as much as you want, while building lasting relationships with your consumers.</p>

        <p>Buyers have access to the freshest produce and artisinal products that are available in your local area. Orders can be picked up directly from the producer, or shipped to your local farmers market or food hub. 
        <br>
        <h2> Support Local, Think Global</h2> 
         <h3>Where your food comes from matters</h3>
         <p>Currently, the average meal travels 1200 km from the farm to plate. Food that is grown closer to home will therefore have fewer transportation emissions associated with it, and also be fresher and support local farmers. And as the distance food travels decreases, so does the need for processing and refrigeration to reduce spoilage.</p>
